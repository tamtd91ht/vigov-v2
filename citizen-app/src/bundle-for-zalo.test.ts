/**
 * WHAT THIS CATCHES THAT NOTHING ELSE DOES:
 *
 *   `base: "./"` in vite.config.ts is the line between a working Mini App and a WHITE SCREEN on
 *   a real phone. A Mini App is served from a platform-chosen path, so an absolute `/assets/…`
 *   URL resolves to nothing. The cruel part: `vite preview`, `npm run dev`, `tsc` and every
 *   other test in this repository stay perfectly green when that line is removed, because they
 *   all serve from a root. The failure appears for the first time on a reviewer's device.
 *
 *   So this test builds the bundle FOR REAL — the same config `npm run build` uses — and reads
 *   the asset URLs that were actually emitted. It is one end-to-end check instead of five unit
 *   tests asserting the config object back at itself.
 *
 * The build runs in memory (`write: false`): nothing is written to `dist/`, and the config is
 * picked up from the package root the way `npm run build` picks it up.
