# citizen-app

The citizen-facing **Zalo Mini App**. React + Vite + zmp-sdk.

Citizens are identified by phone plus OTP — a **weak identity**, not to be trusted. And they
**do not choose** this software: being unable to use it means being unable to reach a public
service. That makes accessibility a rights question, not a preference.

## One app, every commune

A Mini App is identified by its platform App ID, not a domain, so the "tell communes apart by
domain" strategy does not apply here. The commune is resolved at runtime — see
`src/lib/commune-resolution.ts`.

## Non-negotiables

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| 1 | GPS **suggests**, never **decides** |
| 2 | Once selected, the commune name appears on **every** screen |
| 3 | Switching commune is an explicit action, never automatic |
| 4 | Identity comes from the session; the backend never trusts a client-supplied identity |
| 5 | The commune is confirmed again at the final step before submitting |
| 6 | Body text ≥ 16px · touch targets ≥ 44×44px · contrast ≥ 4.5:1 · status never by colour alone |
| 7 | Error messages say what to do next, never an error code |
| 8 | Nothing personal in logs, URLs, or file names |

## Error message shape

| Wrong | Right |
|---|---|
| `Error 422: Validation failed` | "Số điện thoại chưa đúng. Nhập 10 số, bắt đầu bằng 0." |
| `Unauthorized` | "Phiên đăng nhập đã hết. Đăng nhập lại để tiếp tục." |
